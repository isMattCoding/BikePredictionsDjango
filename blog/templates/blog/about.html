      Motivated by the surge in cyclist activity across Paris post-COVID, I embarked on a mission to provide valuable
      insights to cyclists in the city. Utilizing open data from la Ville de Paris, I initiated a proof of concept aimed
      at predicting bike usage frequency. Driven by a desire to equip cyclists with the information they need to
      anticipate road congestion, I delved into the datasets with fervor. My goal was to offer practical insights that
      could assist cyclists in navigating the bustling streets of Paris with ease and confidence, ultimately promoting
      sustainable urban mobility.

      Initially, I processed the data using an open-source machine learning model known as SILVERKITE within a Jupyter
      Notebook environment. However, I encountered challenges with the static nature of this approach, as distributing
      and reproducing the results proved difficult. Seeking a more dynamic and scalable solution, I developed a Django
      application. This application integrates with the OpenData Paris API to fetch real-time data and automatically
      applies the predictive model. Transitioning to this web-based platform allowed for a more dynamic and accessible
      tool, empowering users to effortlessly access predictions on bike usage frequency in Paris.

      While I could have opted to showcase predictions for all streets of Paris, I made the strategic decision to
      initially concentrate on Boulevard Sébastopol. Renowned as the Parisian street with the highest bike traffic, it
      presented a compelling focal point for the proof of concept. By narrowing the scope to this bustling thoroughfare,
      I aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of the predictive model in a concentrated and impactful manner. Focusing on
      Boulevard Sébastopol not only highlighted the potential of the application but also provided valuable insights
      that could directly benefit cyclists navigating one of the city's busiest routes. This targeted approach allowed
      for a focused analysis, paving the way for future expansion to encompass additional streets across Paris.

      There are a number of improvements that can be made to scale this project and improve the accuracy of the machine
      learning model. If you wish to contribute, please check out the
